# Alexander Burovanov's - Application Host Unit (AHU) Zephyr Drivers

## Overview

An Application Host Unit (AHU) application designed to run on the NRF52840DK development board in order to control various peripherals.

## Implementation

The Application Host Unit (AHU) zephyr driver is a multi-threaded application driver which supports a variety of peripherals.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the project can be seen below.

*NOTE: the files which are not listed above are generated by west and were not implemented by me.*

## Usage Instructions

After the project is running on the board, using the serial monitor of your choosing connect to the board with a baud rate of `115200`.
Once loaded you can enter the `help` command which will explain the usage of each of the functions available on the device.

## Build Instructions

The following commands can be used to flash either project by altering the project path and the target board.
This example assumes you are flashing the NRF5280DK board with the AHU firmware.
*Note: these steps assume you have already got a working install of zephyr and west*

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. In the `/transmitter` directory call `west init`.
3. In the `/transmitter` directory call `west update`.
4. Build the project for your board of choice using - `west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 transmitter/ahu -p`
5. Flash the code to the board by calling `west flash --recover`
